# Insurance_Prediction

Description:

In the "Healthcare Charges Prediction Project," I developed a machine learning model to predict medical charges for individuals based on various factors. Using Python and the scikit-learn library, I built a simple linear regression model to analyze a dataset containing information such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking habits, and region. To handle categorical features, I applied appropriate encoding techniques.

By splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, I trained the model on a portion of the data and evaluated its performance on unseen data. The model's predictive capabilities were assessed by calculating the charges for the test set and comparing the predicted values with the actual charges.
